# Lesson 2 - Kickoff!

Once the build season begins, all subteams will be very busy. It's important to manage the scouting team resources to ensure everything is done before competition season begins. The system needs to be programmed, scouts need to be trained, and strategists need to be prepared to create picklists from observations and data.
