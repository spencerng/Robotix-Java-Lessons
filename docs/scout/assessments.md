If you missed the deadlines stated above, you'll need to DM the scouting lead(s) for a link.

### Week Zero

A crucial part of scouting is preparation for actual competition by scouting [Week Zero](https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2018week0) matches. We'll be doing this during the meeting on **Wednesday, February 20, 2019**. 

If you are absent and have an Android phone, [follow these instructions](./appusage.md) to install and use the app. 

You'll need to scout at least three of the following four matches. Despite what the Field Management System says, please label the matches with the match numbers given here and the position **Red 1** for each robot. Also, use your real name!

Once you're done, DM your data to the scouting lead(s) via Slack by using the **Export Data** feature on the main menu to the app. Please complete this by **Tuesday, February 19, 2019**.

Of course, don't worry about it if you don't have an Android device; you'll get the chance to practice scout at the next meeting.
