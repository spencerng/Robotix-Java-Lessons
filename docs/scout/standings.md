## 2018 Ranking Method

Three categories are used to score scouts:

### Theory (2x weighting)

* Question-based material based on FRC event rules and the *FIRST* Power Up manual
* Quiz 1 - worth 100 points
    * Each question has different weighting
    * Partial credit awarded for multiple select/answer questions
    * Rubric used to grade open-ended questions
* Opportunity to take Quiz 2 - worth 100 points
    * Theory score/average will be based on three highest scores from all assessments
* Kahoots - worth 100 points each
    * Points awarded is $100 \cdot {\frac{\text{correct answers}}{\text{total questions answered}}}$, rounded to the nearest integer
    * Opportunities to make up if you werenâ€™t present at the meeting

### Skill (3x weighting)
* Accuracy of scouting matches from Week Zero
* Four assigned matches worth 100 points each
    * Skill score/average will be based on three highest scores from all matches
* Formula used to assess accuracy of the data in each section of the app
    * Prematch, auto, teleop, and postmatch data each given different weightings

### Punctuality (75x weighting)

* Commitment to the scouting team, communication, and reliability
    * Points deducted each time something is completed past its due date
    * Registration, quizzes/kahoots, etc.
    * 1 pt deduction for less than one week late
    * 2 pt deduction for one week or more late
* If you registered late, deductions for past due assignments begin 1 week after you registered
    * 0 pt deduction if completed in less than 1 week after registration
    * 1 pt deduction if completed 1-2 weeks after you registered
    * 2 pt deduction if more than 2 weeks
* All scouts begin with 20 points, unless you registered late

Two methods are used for a composite assessment of scouts:

### Running Score (primary method)
* Category scores (punctuality/theory/skill) are simply points earned from items from that category added together
* Running score is $75 \cdot \text{punctuality score} + 2 \cdot \text{theory score} + 3 \cdot \text{skill score}$
* The higher the score, the better!
    * Maximum is 3000, without bonuses
* Rewards completing assessments (including optional ones) and a high punctuality score 

### "Average" (secondary method)
* Category averages (punctuality/theory/skill) are the average of points earned from items of that category
    * Averages are 100 if no points are attainable from that category yet
* Average is $0.5 \cdot \text{punctuality average} + 0.2 \cdot \text{theory average} + 0.3 \cdot \text{skill average}$
* The higher the average, the better!
    * Maximum is 100
* May not be an accurate depiction of how committed a scout is, but easier to understand and very similar to a school average

**Remember, your performance is relative to the rest of the scouting team - let's just take scouting seriously to help us win competitions!**
