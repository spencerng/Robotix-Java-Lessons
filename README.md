# Robotix Java Lessons

This repository provides a series of no-frills Java lessons that prepares students on [*FIRST* Robotics Competition Team 25 - Raider Robotix](http://www.raiderrobotix.org/) to program an FRC robot and the team's electronic scouting system.

The course is designed to take place around the year, with 8 lessons covering the basics of Java and object orientated programming (July - October), 4 lessons covering either WPILib or Android/Java desktop GUI (November - December) so that students may "shadow" and assist subteam leaders during the build season, and 2 lessons on how to use the scouting system and analyze data (January - February) in preparation for the competition season.
